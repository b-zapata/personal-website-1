I learned all four swimming styles, and began to train every day. During training I realized that I was really close to the Chilean freestyle 50m national record for my age, so I decided I wanted to do it competitively. However, they closed my city's olympic pool when I was 13 for repairs and I lost momentum. I never got back into competitive swimming, but I do it now as a hobby and as a way to stay fit.",
