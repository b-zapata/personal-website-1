          "I started learning to play the piano when I was about 5. My mom was my first piano teacher, and she taught me mainly classical and church music. When I was 13 I joined the School of Music of Antofagasta, where I learned with professional musicians, attended master classes, and played as a soloist with the student orchestra. Today, I've expanded my repertoire to movie scores, jazz, pop, folk, and a few other music styles.",

When I was an exchange student during my senior year of high school, I joined Millennial Choirs and Orchestras. I participated in the youth choir for a year, and in the grand chorus for another year after I graduated high school. I also participated in the multicultural choir that would have sang at the April 2020 General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which went online because of COVID. I have also conducted choirs at my local church community and sang in a few ensambles with friends.",

I learned all four swimming styles, and began to train every day. During training I realized that I was really close to the Chilean freestyle 50m national record for my age, so I decided I wanted to do it competitively. However, they closed my city's olympic pool when I was 13 for repairs. I never got back into competitive swimming, but I do it now as a hobby and as a way to stay fit.",

Going out of my way to perform simple acts of kindness and service to those around me, starting by my family, is one of the best ways to show my beliefs. I have been actively involved in volunteer service in my local church communtiy since I was young, the most remarkable so far being my service for two years as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
