                I was born in Santiago, Chile, and when I was 8, I moved to
                Antofagasta, in the north of Chile, where I lived most of my
                teenage years. When I was 16, I came to the United States as an
                international exchange student and attended Liahona Preparatory
                Academy, where I did my senior year and graduated high school.
                At age 17 I started studying at BYU. I took classes from varying
                fields and got familiar with different career paths, and on my
                sophomore year, I finally decided on majoring in Information
                Systems.

                I did five semesters at BYU before leaving as a volunteer
                missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
                where I served in my native city of Santiago, Chile for a year,
                and then in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for the remaining year of my
                mission. I recently completed the Information Systems junior
                core, and am currently preparing to start the integrated Masters
                of Information Systems program at BYU. I am the youngest of four
                siblings and the proud uncle of two nephews and three nieces. I
                love trying out and learning new thingsâ€”you can find a list of
